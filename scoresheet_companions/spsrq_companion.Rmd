## 1. Background

This companion file is for The Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire (SPSRQ), which is a 48 yesâ€“no response item questionnaire which incorporates two scales: sensitivity to punishment (24 items) and sensitivity to reward (24 items).

Reference 1: ["A psychometric evaluation of behavioral inhibition
and approach self-report measures"] (https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-06594-018)

Reference 2: ["The Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire (SPSRQ) as a measure of Gray's anxiety and impulsivity dimensions"] (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886900001835)


## 2. Scoresheet

In order to clean the data:

(1) Selects raw variables being used for the current measure

(2) Renames variables to be easily identified

(3) Sum scores and rename these as spsrq_reward_SUM and spsrq_punishiment_SUM
